
Notable extra functionality (compared to what we agreed on):
------------------------------------------------------------

-Instance monitor.
If an instance is already running, it will be detected and will be brought forward (instead of starting a 2nd instance of the application).

-Log improvements: when started, logs go to a default log file, old log file is renamed (based on lastmod attribute).
Logs are kep for a constant number of days, then automatically deleted on startup.

-The replay folder input text field changes background if the provided folder does not exist or is not a folder (but a file).
An error tool tip is also set in this case.

-Status and stats are displayed (Status, Successful uploads, Failed uploads).

-Clickable HTML version link opening the home page in the user's default browser in a platform independent way.

-InfoMainClass registered as the main class of the main jar (ggtracker-uploader.jar) which when tried to run displays an info dialog about proper usage.

-The tray icon shows the main window for a single click on Windows, and it has a popup menu on non-windows having one menu item to show the main window.
